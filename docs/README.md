# LiveVue Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for LiveVue, a library that enables seamless integration between Phoenix LiveView and Vue.js.

## Documentation Structure

- **[Architecture](architecture.md)**: Detailed explanation of the LiveVue architecture and components

## Diagrams

All diagrams are created using Mermaid, which is supported natively by GitHub Markdown. The diagrams include:

1. **High-Level Architecture**: Overview of the main components of LiveVue
2. **Component Flow**: How components are rendered from Elixir to Vue
3. **Data Flow**: How data moves between Phoenix LiveView and Vue components
4. **SSR Process**: Server-side rendering process flow
5. **Class Diagram**: Module structure and relationships
6. **Component Lifecycle**: Lifecycle of a LiveVue component

## Generating Diagrams

The diagrams can be regenerated or modified using the scripts in the `diagrams` directory. See the [Diagrams README](../diagrams/README.md) for more information.
