Building LiveVue UI: Extending live_vue into a Comprehensive Component Library

LiveVue’s Current Capabilities: Strengths and Limitations

End-to-End Reactivity with Vue and LiveView: live_vue (LiveVue) enables seamless integration of Vue.js components into Phoenix LiveView applications. It provides end-to-end reactivity, meaning server-side state and client-side state stay in sync automatically ￼. Developers can render Vue components within LiveView templates and handle events as if they were native LiveView components. For example, standard Phoenix attributes like phx-click or phx-change work inside Vue components, and Vue emits can trigger LiveView JS commands or server events via the v-on binding ￼ ￼. This hybrid approach leverages LiveView for server-driven UI updates while using Vue for rich interactive behaviors.

Key Features of live_vue: LiveVue supports server-side rendering (SSR) of Vue components for initial page load, lazy-loading of components, and even a ~V sigil for inline Vue templates ￼. It replaces Phoenix’s default esbuild with Vite, delivering an “amazing developer experience” through fast, stateful hot-reloads across the entire stack ￼. Other niceties include out-of-the-box Tailwind CSS support, slot interoperability between Phoenix and Vue, and support for LiveView “dead views” (static renders) ￼. In short, live_vue’s strengths lie in marrying Phoenix’s real-time server push model with Vue’s client-side reactivity and vast ecosystem ￼.

Strengths – Developer Experience and Ecosystem: By using Vite, LiveVue offers near-instant compilation and live reloading for both Elixir and Vue code changes, even propagating CSS tweaks without full refresh ￼. This dramatically improves development speed and feedback (e.g. editing a Tailwind class in a LiveView template updates the running app’s style immediately ￼). Another strength is access to the entire Vue ecosystem – developers can tap into Vue’s libraries for state management, animation, charts, etc., directly in a Phoenix project ￼. In fact, LiveVue began as a fork of a similar Svelte integration, but Vue’s larger community and the Vue 3 reactivity system (based on proxies) provide a robust foundation ￼ ￼. Vue’s performance is on par with Svelte and plenty fast for typical use ￼, so using Vue won’t be a bottleneck in practice. Overall, LiveVue’s design lets you avoid convoluted JavaScript hooks in LiveView and instead use Vue’s declarative UI for complex interactive parts ￼.

Current Limitations: Despite its capabilities, live_vue has some limitations to acknowledge. One is the initialization delay for Vue components on first load – the LiveView hook mounts the Vue app only after the JS bundle is loaded, so without SSR you might see a brief flash or delay in interactive components rendering ￼ ￼. Enabling SSR mitigates this by pre-rendering the component HTML on the server ￼, but developers should be aware of this nuance. There are also technical quirks: for instance, when passing Phoenix template content into a Vue slot, LiveVue wraps each slot’s content in an extra <div> due to integration constraints ￼. This means the DOM structure might include an extra container element. Furthermore, some advanced LiveView features aren’t yet directly supported – e.g. Phoenix streams (for dynamic lists) are not integrated with LiveVue’s reactivity as of now (though support is on the roadmap) ￼. Handling of form inputs and changesets might require custom wiring, as a built-in solution (useLiveForm) is planned but not available yet ￼. Another limitation is that LiveVue introduces a Node/Vite toolchain to a Phoenix project, which is a necessary trade-off for Vue integration but adds complexity to setup and deployment. Finally, while LiveVue already optimizes payloads (only sending props/events to the client when they change), the current version still sends full JSON-encoded props on change ￼. More granular diffing (sending only the changed fields or using JSON patch) is planned but not fully implemented yet ￼ ￼. These are not deal-breakers, but they highlight areas to improve as we extend LiveVue into a larger component framework.

Best Practices for Extending LiveVue into a UI Library

To build LiveVue UI as a comprehensive component library, we should follow best practices that leverage LiveVue’s strengths while mitigating its weaknesses. Here are key considerations:
	•	Maintain Clear Separation of Concerns: Design components such that UI presentation and local interaction are handled in Vue, while business logic and persistent state reside in LiveView (server assigns). This means a component’s Vue part should manage transient UI state (e.g. dropdown open/close, animations) locally for snappy responsiveness, and only emit events to the LiveView when server-side action or data persistence is needed (e.g. form submission, saving a selection). This reduces unnecessary round trips and keeps the server-side simpler. LiveVue makes this easy by letting Vue emit events that trigger LiveView handlers via JS.push or similar hooks ￼.
	•	Use LiveView for Data, Vue for Display: For each component, decide which props truly need to come from the server. For example, a chart component might receive data points from LiveView assigns, but handle client-side interactions (zoom, tooltip) entirely in Vue. Conversely, a form component might use Vue for validation feedback but still send the final input to the server on submit. By carefully dividing responsibilities, we prevent duplicating state. A good rule is to let LiveView own any state that must be consistent across users or affect server-side computations, and let Vue own ephemeral UI state. This hybrid model is exactly why LiveVue was created – to handle “complex local state” on the client while keeping global app state on the server ￼.
	•	Component API Design – Make it Intuitive: Design the API of each LiveVue UI component to feel natural to Phoenix developers. Ideally, using a component from the library should be as simple as using a built-in HEEx component. We can achieve this by wrapping LiveVue’s <.vue ...> calls inside Phoenix function components for cleaner syntax. For example, instead of requiring developers to write:

<.vue v-component="Modal" title="My Modal" v-on:close={JS.push("modal_close")} .../>

we can provide a helper like <.Modal title="My Modal" on_close="modal_close" .../>. The implementation of <.Modal> in the library would internally call the LiveVue <.vue> component with appropriate attributes (v-component="Modal", passing assigns as props, and wiring the on_close to JS.push). This abstraction improves usability by hiding the low-level details. We should keep naming and attributes consistent with Phoenix conventions (e.g. using snake_case for props, on_event for callbacks) to lower the learning curve.

	•	Colocate and Organize Components: It’s beneficial to colocate Vue component files alongside their corresponding LiveView modules or within a structured directory in the library. LiveVue supports having Vue files in the Phoenix lib/ directory (next to .ex files) for better developer experience ￼. We should structure the library so that each component lives in a well-defined namespace (for example, LiveVueUI.Modal with a modal.vue file next to it). Colocation means when a developer opens the project, they can easily find the Vue file implementing the UI and the Elixir module (if any) that wraps or configures it. This aligns with LiveVue’s advice that Vue files in many cases serve a similar role to HEEx templates and can be stored together with LiveViews for convenience ￼.
	•	Leverage Vue’s Composition API and Plugins: Since LiveVue uses Vue 3, we should embrace Vue 3 best practices internally. Use the Composition API (<script setup>, ref, computed, etc.) for clean, reactive component logic. Also, take advantage of Vue plugins if needed – for instance, integrating a global store or utilities. LiveVue makes it possible to customize the Vue application instance creation. We can install plugins like Pinia (state management) or VueUse (common composition utilities) by modifying the createLiveVue setup in assets/vue/index.js ￼ ￼. This means our component library can offer advanced features (like a centralized client-side store for certain UI state) if we find it necessary, simply by including and initializing those plugins. The LiveVue library already provides a hook (setup) where we can app.use(pinia) or any other Vue plugin before mounting ￼ ￼. Best practice is to keep such integrations optional – include them only if a component truly requires it, to avoid bloating apps that don’t need a global store. By designing with Vue’s ecosystem in mind, we ensure the LiveVue UI library remains extensible; developers could even add their own Vue plugins on top of our components thanks to this flexibility.
	•	Ensure Accessibility and UX Consistency: When building UI components, especially with a mix of server and client, it’s crucial to maintain accessibility standards. We should follow ARIA patterns for any interactive components (modals, tabs, tooltips, etc.) so that they are screen-reader friendly and keyboard navigable. LiveVue UI should adopt an accessibility-first mindset from the start. This not only benefits end-users but also aligns with Phoenix LiveView’s philosophy of generating semantic HTML. We’ll further achieve this by integrating with Reka UI (covered below), which is built around accessible components. Also, ensure the components degrade gracefully – for example, if a Vue component fails to load, the SSR content (if provided) should still show, or at least the page remains functional. Keeping consistent styling and behavior across components (e.g. uniform focus outlines, animation speeds, etc.) will make the library feel cohesive.
	•	Testing and Compatibility: Because we are extending a relatively new library, thorough testing is a best practice. We should write unit tests for the Vue components (using Jest or Vitest in the Vite setup) to verify props and emitted events work as expected. In parallel, integration tests using Phoenix’s test framework can mount LiveViews that use our components and simulate events (perhaps via Phoenix LiveView test API or headless browser tests) to ensure the end-to-end behavior (server update -> client update and vice versa) is solid. This is important for catching edge cases where the boundary between LiveView and Vue might break. Also, we need to monitor compatibility with Phoenix LiveView updates – since LiveVue relies on LiveView (and Phoenix) internals, any version bumps should be tested. Our component library should specify clearly which versions of Phoenix/LiveView it supports. Staying in sync with live_vue updates (which is evolving fast) is part of the practice; for example, if live_vue introduces a new diffing optimization or API change, our library might need adjustments. A good practice is to lock the live_vue dependency to a tested version and periodically update after validating the changes (reading the live_vue changelog ￼ ￼ is useful to catch breaking changes or new features like the createLiveVue API introduced in 0.5.0 ￼).

By following these best practices, we set a strong foundation for LiveVue UI: our components will be well-structured, easy to use, and maintainable, making full use of both Phoenix LiveView and Vue capabilities.

Integrating Reka UI Components Effectively

A cornerstone of building a comprehensive component library will be leveraging Reka UI components within LiveVue. Reka UI (formerly Radix Vue) is an open-source library of unstyled, accessible Vue components that provide low-level UI building blocks ￼ ￼. Integrating Reka’s “visualization” components (i.e. its UI primitives) allows us to deliver a broad range of functionality without reinventing the wheel, especially for complex interactive behaviors.

Why Reka UI? Reka UI is built with an accessibility-first approach – its components adhere to WAI-ARIA design patterns and handle focus management, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes out of the box ￼. This aligns with our goal of usability: by using Reka under the hood, LiveVue UI components will be accessible to all users by default. Reka components are also unstyled and customizable ￼, which means we can apply our own design system (e.g. Tailwind CSS classes) to craft the look and feel of LiveVue UI, without being constrained by a pre-made theme. This gives us flexibility to define a consistent style across all components in the library while still benefiting from Reka’s tested logic.

Controlled vs. Uncontrolled State: A major advantage of Reka UI is that its components support both uncontrolled and controlled usage ￼. By default, a Reka component manages its state internally (uncontrolled), but it also exposes props and events to let a parent control it. We will use this to our benefit in LiveVue UI. For interactions that don’t need server intervention, we can allow the Reka component to handle everything on the client side (for example, a Tabs component can manage which tab is active internally). However, when the application needs to react to a UI change on the server (say, a selected item in a Dropdown Menu needs to trigger a server update), we can switch that component into a controlled mode: LiveView provides the value as a prop, and the component emits an event whenever the user changes it. Our library will capture that event (via v-on in the LiveVue integration) and push it to the LiveView, so the server state updates. This pattern ensures effective two-way binding where necessary, while keeping most interactions snappy and local. For example, using Reka’s Dialog component for a modal: we might let it open/close on its own (uncontrolled) when the user clicks buttons, but also provide an onClose event that notifies LiveView so the server knows the dialog was closed (if needed for business logic). Conversely, LiveView could control the open state of the Dialog by passing a prop, allowing the server to show/hide modals based on server-side events. Reka’s design supports this dual approach, giving us fine-grained control over what runs on client vs server ￼.

Integration Strategy: To integrate Reka UI, we will add Reka as an npm dependency in the LiveVue UI project (since LiveVue uses Vite, it can easily bundle the Reka library). We’ll import Reka components within our Vue files and compose them to create the final UI components of our library. In some cases, a LiveVue UI component might simply wrap a Reka component with some preset configuration and styling. For example, a LiveVue UI “Dropdown” component can use Reka’s <DropdownMenu> under the hood, apply Tailwind classes for styling, and connect the open/close events to LiveView as needed. Because Reka components are unstyled primitives, part of our work is to define a default styling/theme. We can utilize Tailwind CSS (already supported in LiveVue ￼) to style each component consistently. This involves writing CSS classes or using Tailwind utility classes in the Vue templates of our components to achieve a polished look (e.g. modal backdrops, active menu item highlights, etc.). We should create a theme guide so that all components share the same design language (colors, spacing, typography). Developers can then either use the default theme or override classes to customize the look.

Addressing Complex Components: Reka UI offers ~40+ primitive components covering a wide range of UI patterns (menus, dialogs, popovers, tooltips, form controls, etc.) ￼. We should review these and plan to include those that are most useful for Phoenix apps. Likely candidates are: buttons, forms (input, checkbox, radio), navigation components (tabs, navbar, breadcrumb), feedback components (modal dialogs, toasts, tooltips), and data display (accordion, table, etc.). Each of these will be a combination of Reka logic + our styling + LiveView integration. For interactive visualizations like charts or graphs (if by “visualization components” the intent was to include charts), Reka UI itself might not cover them since it’s focused on UI primitives. In such cases, we can integrate other Vue libraries (for example, Chart.js via a Vue wrapper, or ECharts Vue component). LiveVue allows using any Vue component, so a chart library can be treated similarly. We would ensure the chart component receives data from LiveView as props and emits events (like onClick on a data point) back to LiveView if needed. The key is to follow the same integration pattern we use for Reka components: keep the heavy rendering on the client, and only send minimal events or updates to the server.

SSR and Hydration Considerations: When using Reka components, we must ensure they work with SSR since LiveVue can server-render the initial HTML. Most Reka UI components should support SSR (since they are designed for Vue 3 and generally do not rely on browser-only APIs during render). We will test SSR for each component; if any component has issues (for example, needing access to window on mount), we may need to enable it only in client-side mode or find a workaround. Ensuring SSR compatibility means the initial page will show the fully rendered UI even before Vue hydrates it, improving perceived performance and SEO. Also, we’ll take advantage of LiveVue’s capability to lazy-load Vue components ￼. For rarely used or heavy components (perhaps a large chart or a complex datagrid), we can define them as lazy-loaded – LiveVue will not include them in the initial JS bundle, but rather load them on demand when the component is actually rendered. Our library’s documentation can advise developers how to mark components for lazy load (using Vite’s dynamic import syntax, as shown in LiveVue docs ￼). We might even ship the library with a default that most bulky components are set to lazy by default, to optimize apps that include the whole library.

Styling Approach: Since Reka components are unstyled, all visual polish comes from our side. We’ll likely define a set of Tailwind utility classes or CSS variables to standardize things like colors (matching perhaps Phoenix’s default or a popular design system). We can provide light and dark mode variants if needed. A good approach is to keep the styling layer separate enough that users of the library can override or customize if they wish. For example, use Tailwind config to define a color palette for the library and apply classes accordingly; if a developer wants a different palette, they could override those config values and rebuild. We should also document how to swap out styles easily (since one principle of Reka is customization ￼, we should not lock users into our default aesthetic if they want to change it).

In summary, integrating Reka effectively means composing its accessible components to form our high-level components, using controlled props to tie into LiveView when necessary. This approach accelerates development (leveraging well-tested primitives) and ensures the resulting UI library is both accessible and flexible. By doing this, LiveVue UI becomes essentially a Phoenix-tailored wrapper around the best parts of the Vue ecosystem (Reka for UI primitives, possibly other Vue libs for specific needs), delivered in a way that feels native to LiveView.

Performance Optimization Strategies for LiveView + Vue

Combining Phoenix LiveView with Vue introduces unique performance considerations. We need to ensure that our LiveVue UI library remains snappy and efficient even as it scales to many components on a page. Below are strategies to optimize performance in this hybrid environment:
	•	Minimize Data Transfer with Smart Diffing: LiveView by itself sends minimal diffs over the WebSocket for UI updates. LiveVue extends this to Vue by only updating the component’s props when they change ￼. We should continue this practice: make sure our LiveView assigns for components are as granular as possible so that a change in one component’s state doesn’t re-send an entire large payload. For instance, if a page has many LiveVue UI components, each with its own state, updates to one component should not cause props for others to resend. LiveVue helps by marking changed assigns so only those get serialized to the client ￼. As the library evolves, we’ll adopt upcoming improvements like sending only the changed fields of a nested prop or using JSON patch for deep updates ￼ ￼. These will further cut down data size. We should track live_vue updates and incorporate them once available (e.g., if LiveVue introduces an official diff mechanism for props, use it).
	•	Leverage SSR for Initial Load: We enable server-side rendering of Vue components in LiveVue UI wherever it makes sense. SSR can significantly improve the load performance by delivering fully rendered HTML on first paint, so the user sees a populated UI immediately ￼. The Vue component will then hydrate and take over for interactivity. This approach reduces the perception of lag and also avoids a burst of client-side rendering work on large components at startup. We should ensure our components’ SSR rendering is optimized (e.g., heavy calculations should ideally happen server-side during SSR if possible, to offload the client). Phoenix LiveView will only SSR components on the initial (disconnected) render by design, so after the live socket connects, updates are diff-only. That means SSR cost is paid once per component per navigation, which is usually fine. In cases where SSR is not needed (maybe the component is trivial or above-the-fold content is static), we can choose to skip SSR to save server CPU. But generally, SSR is a net win for performance and should be used for most UI components.
	•	Lazy-load and Code-Split Components: As mentioned earlier, lazy-loading Vue components can greatly improve both initial load time and memory usage. Using Vite’s code-splitting, we will ensure that components not immediately needed aren’t bundled in the initial app.js. For example, if our library includes a heavy DataGrid component but a particular app only shows it on one admin page, that code should be split out. LiveVue already supports marking components for lazy loading via dynamic import ￼. We’ll provide our library’s Vite setup (or instructions) to include lazy imports for certain components by default. Additionally, we can document how developers can cherry-pick components to include. Since not every app will use all components, tree-shaking (which Reka UI supports ￼) and manual inclusion can reduce the JS footprint. In essence, scalability of the library means that including more components shouldn’t linearly worsen performance – unused parts should have near-zero cost. We will verify that unused components indeed get dropped from the bundle (Vite’s analysis and testing with example builds will help).
	•	Optimize Client-Side Rendering: Vue’s virtual DOM diffing is very fast for typical UI sizes, but we should still code our Vue components efficiently. This means avoiding expensive computations in templates on each render (use computed properties to cache results), and leveraging Vue’s reactive primitives appropriately (ref, reactive). If a component has large lists, we might use Vue’s v-for with keyed items and consider virtual scrolling for extremely large lists to limit DOM nodes. Also, where appropriate, use Vue’s performance features like defineComponent optimizations or even the upcoming Vue “Vapor mode” (compiled reactivity without virtual DOM) once it’s stable ￼. Since LiveVue can handle a lot of server-side state, we should ensure our client components don’t become the bottleneck. For instance, if we have a chart component showing thousands of points, the heavy lifting (aggregating data) might be better done on the server or webworker, with the Vue component only handling rendering. We can consider web workers for expensive client-side tasks if needed, and Vite can help bundle those.
	•	Throttling and Debouncing Events: A potential performance pitfall is flooding the server with too many events from the client. For example, a slider or drag-and-drop might emit dozens of events per second. While Phoenix can handle many events, it’s wise to throttle or debounce certain client interactions to a reasonable rate. In our Vue components, we can implement debouncing for high-frequency events before calling emit to LiveView. Alternatively, use LiveView’s phx-throttle/phx-debounce on events (though those don’t directly apply inside Vue, we can mimic the behavior). By limiting event frequency, we prevent saturating the LiveView process with trivial updates. For example, a search autocomplete component could collect input on every key stroke locally but only send a query event after the user stops typing for 300ms. This keeps the UX smooth and the server load manageable.
	•	Utilize LiveView Scoping for Updates: Phoenix LiveView allows component isolation – if one part of the UI is a stateful LiveComponent, updates there don’t redraw the entire parent view. In the context of LiveVue, each embedded Vue component is effectively like a LiveComponent from LiveView’s perspective (because it’s encapsulated in its own div with data attributes). We should ensure this isolation remains: if a page has multiple LiveVue components, updating one should not cause re-render diff on others. Practically, as long as they have distinct assigns and IDs, LiveView will target diffs correctly. We may consider recommending that each LiveVue UI component in a LiveView be wrapped in its own HEEx component or have an id to avoid any diff collisions. Testing with many components on a page can help verify that performance remains linear.
	•	Monitoring and Profiling: As we develop the library, we will continuously profile performance. Tools like Phoenix LiveDashboard (telemetry) can show the size of LiveView diffs and the frequency of events, which helps catch any inefficiencies in server communication. On the client side, Vue DevTools can be used to inspect component redraws and check for unnecessary re-renders. We should set up some demo pages with lots of components (a “kitchen sink” page) to simulate a real heavy UI, then measure memory usage, CPU, and network traffic. This will guide optimizations (maybe we find a certain component is chatty or a certain pattern causes large diffs, etc., and then we can refine that). Performance should also include considering latency: although LiveView is real-time, network latency can affect UX. If our components rely on a round-trip for some action, we might look into optimistic UI updates (e.g., assume success and update UI instantly, then correct if server says otherwise). Such patterns could be implemented in Vue for a better user experience.

By applying these strategies, we aim for a LiveVue UI library that scales to complex interfaces without compromising on responsiveness. The combination of server-side efficiency (diffs, SSR) and client-side best practices (lazy load, throttling, efficient rendering) will ensure that using many LiveVue UI components doesn’t overwhelm the application. Performance optimization is an ongoing process, but building with these principles from the start will make the library robust and fast.

Enhancing Developer Experience: Docs, Playground, and Tooling

A component library is only as good as the adoption it garners, and a key to adoption is a great developer experience (DX). We want developers to find LiveVue UI easy to learn, integrate, and extend. To achieve that, we will invest in documentation, interactive examples, and convenient tools:
	•	Comprehensive Documentation: We will create a dedicated documentation site for LiveVue UI, likely generated from Markdown or a site generator. Each component should have its own page detailing its purpose, props (attributes), events emitted, and examples of usage in a Phoenix LiveView template. Because our library straddles Elixir and Vue, the docs should show both sides: for example, the Elixir code (LiveView assign or call) and the corresponding rendered Vue template snippet or behavior. We will include code snippets for common use cases (e.g., “Here’s how to use the <.Modal> component to confirm an action, with an example LiveView module handling the confirm event”). Good documentation also covers edge cases and gotchas – we’ll include notes on things like SSR usage, how to configure lazy loading, how to style components via Tailwind, etc. Since live_vue itself has a README and FAQ ￼ ￼, we can build on that knowledge base, focusing documentation on the specifics of our UI components. Tooling-wise, we might leverage ex_doc (for any Elixir modules we have) and Storybook-like setups for the Vue side.
	•	Interactive Component Playground: It’s important that developers can try out components in real time. We plan to provide a component playground or Storybook environment. One approach is to create a Phoenix LiveView “storyboard” app (similar to how SaladUI provides a storybook demo ￼). In this playground, each LiveVue UI component can be showcased in isolation with controls to modify its props and see the result instantly. For example, a slider component’s page could let you adjust min/max values, toggle some flags, and the UI updates accordingly. Under the hood, this can be a LiveView that renders the component and has UI controls bound to assigns. This not only helps users learn the API, but also serves as a testing ground for us to ensure each component works standalone. Alternatively, since our components are Vue, we could integrate with Vue Storybook (a popular tool for UI component development). We might use Storybook during development to design the Vue components in isolation. However, the difference is that our components expect to be used in a LiveView context (with v-socket and possibly server interactions), so running them purely in Storybook might not cover all cases. A hybrid approach is possible: use Storybook for purely client-side visuals and a Phoenix-based playground for demonstrating LiveView interaction. We’ll ensure that the playground is easily accessible (maybe hosted online) so developers can play with the library without installing anything.
	•	Examples and Recipes: Beyond individual component docs, we’ll include guides for common patterns – e.g., building a form with several LiveVue UI components and handling submission with an Ecto changeset, or combining a chart component with LiveView to live-update data in real-time. These higher-level examples show how the pieces fit together in a real app scenario. Such recipes can live in documentation or blog posts and will help developers quickly pick up best practices. We can use the knowledge from LiveVue’s own examples (if any) and the Elixir community’s LiveView patterns to craft these guides.
	•	Tooling and CLI Integration: To streamline adoption, we will introduce CLI tools to manage the library. One idea is a Mix task (or an installer) to set up LiveVue UI in a new or existing Phoenix project. For instance, mix live_vue_ui.install could perform steps like: add live_vue and the UI library as dependencies, run the mix live_vue.setup (which LiveVue itself provides for installation), install npm packages (Reka UI, etc.), and inject any needed config (like copying a default tailwind.config.js or adding our assets to vite.config.js). This could be built on Phoenix Igniter for sophisticated project patching ￼, as mentioned in the LiveVue roadmap, or simply be a guided setup script. The goal is to reduce the manual steps a developer must take to start using the library – ideally just one command and maybe a couple of config lines.
Additionally, we might create a component generator. For example, mix live_vue_ui.new ComponentName could generate a boilerplate for a new Vue component and corresponding Elixir stubs, following our library’s conventions. This would encourage contributions and allow users to extend the library within their own projects in a consistent way. However, since our aim is to provide a comprehensive set, this might be lower priority than core components and docs.
	•	Developer-Friendly API and Typings: Since part of our audience will write or at least read the Vue component code, we should maintain TypeScript typings and documentation for that side too. LiveVue already improved its typing in recent releases ￼, and Reka UI is fully typed ￼. We will ensure our components have proper TypeScript interfaces for props and emits, so that in an IDE, developers get autocompletion and error checking when using them. This greatly enhances DX, as mistakes can be caught early. We also aim to keep the API surface of each component predictable – for example, using value/onChange consistently for controlled inputs, or open/onClose for disclose-type components. A consistent API makes the library easier to learn (learn one component, and the rest feel familiar).
	•	Continuous Feedback and Improvement: Enhancing DX is an ongoing effort. We will encourage feedback via our GitHub repository and perhaps set up discussions or an Elixir Forum thread for LiveVue UI (similar to how live_vue was introduced on ElixirForum ￼). This lets us hear from early adopters about pain points in installation or usage. For instance, if something is under-documented or if the integration steps are confusing, we can quickly adjust the docs or improve the installer. We can also monitor if any patterns emerge (e.g., if many people ask “How do I do X with LiveVue UI?”, we likely need a guide for X).

In summary, developer experience is a top priority. We will provide clear documentation, an interactive playground, and handy CLI tools to lower the barrier to using LiveVue UI. By doing so, we make the library approachable for Phoenix developers who might not be deeply familiar with Vue, and equally comfortable for Vue developers entering the Phoenix world. A smooth DX means better adoption and community contributions, which will help the library grow and mature.

Plan for Building LiveVue UI (Scalability, Performance, Usability)

Finally, here is a structured plan to build the LiveVue UI component library on top of live_vue, incorporating the best practices and strategies discussed:
	1.	Foundation Setup: Begin by setting up the development environment and project structure. Create a Phoenix umbrella or mix project for the LiveVue UI library. Include Phoenix LiveView and live_vue as dependencies, and verify the LiveVue + Vite integration is working (use mix live_vue.setup to bootstrap Vite, ensure we can render a simple Vue component in a LiveView) ￼. Configure Tailwind CSS and add Reka UI as an npm dependency. This phase ensures all tooling (Phoenix, LiveView, Vite, Tailwind, Reka) is properly configured and plays nicely together. We will also establish a version control structure (maybe a monorepo with an example app for docs, and the library as a separate app).
	2.	Component Design Specification: Plan the list of components to include in the initial version of LiveVue UI. Prioritize commonly needed UI components (buttons, forms, modals, dropdowns, tables, etc.), possibly taking inspiration from existing libraries (Reka’s catalog or Shadcn UI’s list for React ￼ ￼). For each component, write a brief spec: its purpose, the API (props/events) it should have, how it might use Reka or other Vue internals, and any unique LiveView integration concerns. For example, specify that the Modal component will use Reka’s Dialog, have props like title, open (controlled mode), and events like on_confirm, on_cancel that map to LiveView events. Ensuring a clear specification will guide development and keep the API consistent.
	3.	Implement Core Components Iteratively: Start building components one by one, in order of importance. Each component implementation will involve:
	•	Creating the Vue component (or wrapping a Reka component) with appropriate slots and props.
	•	Creating a Phoenix helper (function component) for ease of use, if needed.
	•	Styling the component using Tailwind or CSS.
	•	Wiring up emits to LiveView events using v-on and JS.push (e.g., v-on:confirm={JS.push("modal_confirm")}).
	•	Writing basic tests (Vue side unit test to verify it renders and reacts, and an integration test to ensure a LiveView can handle its events).
	•	Documenting usage of the component in our docs (even if rough notes to be polished later).
We will likely implement a simple component (like Button) first to validate the pattern, then move to more complex ones (like Modal, which involves overlay and focus trapping). With each component, we refine our integration approach. For instance, we might find a pattern to handle the v-socket passing and decide to abstract it. By the end of this phase, aim to have a set of fundamental components ready.
	4.	Integrate Reka UI Primitives: As we implement components, systematically utilize Reka UI for the heavy lifting. For example, when building a DropdownMenu component, use Reka’s dropdown primitives to manage keyboard navigation and aria roles, layering our styling on top. Ensure to read Reka’s documentation for each component to use it correctly (e.g., some Reka components might require specific structure of sub-components). If necessary, contribute to Reka or adapt if we encounter limitations or bugs in using it under LiveVue (open-source synergy). By leveraging Reka, we drastically reduce development time and gain proven accessibility support ￼. We’ll keep a close eye on performance – since Reka components are quite lightweight and tree-shakable, including many of them shouldn’t bloat the bundle ￼. We’ll also verify how Reka’s uncontrolled vs controlled states work in practice in a LiveView context, adjusting our approach if needed (e.g., if a controlled mode requires two-way binding, implement that with care to avoid infinite update loops between server and client).
	5.	Performance Review and Optimization: Once a batch of core components is in place, conduct a performance review. Create pages that include many components to simulate a dashboard or form-heavy application. Use the strategies from the Performance section: enable SSR and test the load time, check that only minimal diffs are sent on interactions (for example, toggling a single accordion shouldn’t resend the whole page state), and profile the client rendering. Optimize any glaring issues. This may involve tweaking how we manage state updates. For instance, if we notice that updating one component causes others to re-render unnecessarily, we might adjust assign usage or isolate components further using phx-update="ignore" on parts of the DOM that Vue manages entirely. Implement lazy loading for bulky components at this stage: mark those imports in the Vite config as dynamic ￼ and test that the component still appears when needed (and that SSR still works for it, if SSR is desired – note that lazy-loaded components can still be SSR’d with proper configuration, as LiveVue’s example shows SSR will render them and include preload hints ￼). Also consider memory footprint: ensure that when components unmount (LiveView navigates away or conditionally removed), the Vue instances are properly destroyed to avoid memory leaks (LiveVue’s hook should handle it ￼, but we must confirm). This phase is about polishing performance so that the library is production-ready.
	6.	Documentation and Example App: With the core library functional, switch focus to documentation and the example playground. Write detailed documentation for each component (if not done in tandem). Set up the docs site structure, possibly as a LiveView app that uses our components (to dogfood our own library). Implement the interactive playground pages where developers can tweak props. This also doubles as an extended test of our components in a realistic scenario. Ensure the docs cover installation steps in detail, including how to set up live_vue (which might involve instructing to use our mix installer or manual steps referencing INSTALLATION.md from LiveVue ￼). Also describe how to include the library’s styles (if we ship a CSS or rely on Tailwind setup). At this stage, it’s helpful to get a few beta testers (perhaps community members on Elixir Forum) to go through the setup and use a component, to see if the documentation is clear and if any DX issues arise. Feedback here can lead to small fixes or clarifications before the official release.
	7.	CLI Tooling and Installation Package: Develop the mix tasks or installation script to simplify adding LiveVue UI to projects. Using the insights from integrating in our example app, script those steps. For example, the task might copy a snippet into the user’s assets/js/app.js to initialize LiveVue if not already, or append import lines for our styles. Test the installer on a fresh Phoenix project to ensure it results in a working setup with minimal effort. If complexity is high, consider wrapping the library into a Phoenix archive or using Igniter which can apply patches (Igniter can insert lines into files programmatically, etc., ￼). The goal is that a user can do something like mix archive.install hex live_vue_ui (if we publish as an archive) or mix live_vue_ui.install and get everything configured.
	8.	Scalability and Future-Proofing: As a final step before release, evaluate the library’s scalability and plan for future growth. “Comprehensive” means we eventually want a wide range of components. Ensure our architecture (both code structure and integration approach) will scale to additional components. For instance, if we want to add a rich text editor or calendar component later, can our current approach handle it? It might be fine, but maybe we identify the need for a common pattern for very stateful components. Also, review the LiveVue roadmap and latest version – incorporate any new features (like if by this time live_vue introduced built-in support for something we did manually). Confirm compatibility with the latest Phoenix LiveView version as well. Given that live_vue was at version 0.5.x as of late 2024 ￼, watch for a 1.0 release or breaking changes. Plan to track live_vue and update our library accordingly.
	9.	Release and Community Engagement: Release LiveVue UI as an open-source project. This involves publishing the package (likely two packages: an Elixir Hex package for any server-side helpers, and an npm package or including assets via Hex for the client side – we need to decide the distribution model). We might simplify by delivering via Hex only, since Phoenix assets can be bundled in priv (like how Phoenix delivers some JS). But using npm for the Vue components could allow independent versioning. In any case, tag a version, write release notes, and announce to the community (ElixirForum, Phoenix mailing list, etc.). Highlight the key features: integration of Vue, accessible components from Reka, and how it boosts productivity. Encourage contributions and issue reports. As users adopt it, be ready to fix bugs and iterate.

Throughout this plan, we keep scalability, performance, and usability in focus. Scalability is addressed by using proven UI primitives (Reka) and ensuring architecture can handle many components. Performance is woven in via SSR, lazy loading, and efficient diffing from the start. Usability (both end-user accessibility and developer experience) is a priority through using accessible components and providing great documentation and tooling. By following this structured plan, we can successfully extend live_vue into a robust LiveVue UI component library that makes building rich, reactive interfaces in Phoenix faster and easier than ever.
